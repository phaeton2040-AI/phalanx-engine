# Babylon RTS Demo

A real-time strategy (RTS) game demo built with [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and TypeScript, showcasing Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture principles.

## Features

- **3D RTS Gameplay**: Move units, attack enemies, and defend with towers
- **Two Teams**: Player team (Blue/Team1) vs Enemy team (Red/Team2)
- **Combat System**: Units and towers automatically attack enemies in range
- **Projectile System**: Visual projectiles with hit detection
- **Selection System**: Click to select units, right-click to move
- **Health System**: Entities take damage and can be destroyed
- **Multiplayer**: 1v1 deterministic lockstep via Phalanx Engine
- **Desync Detection**: State hash verification to ensure synchronized gameplay
- **Fixed-Point Math**: All simulation uses deterministic fixed-point arithmetic via `phalanx-math` for cross-platform consistency

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (if applicable)
git clone <repository-url>
cd babylon-ecs

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with hot reload:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

#### Access from Mobile Devices

The dev server is configured to be accessible from your local network. After running `pnpm dev`, you'll see output like:

```
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: http://192.168.1.100:5173/
```

Use the **Network** URL to access the game from your mobile device. Make sure:

1. Your mobile device is on the same WiFi network as your development machine
2. Your firewall allows incoming connections on port 5173
3. You use the IP address shown in the terminal output

### Environment Configuration

The game server URL is configured via environment variables:

- **`.env`** - Default configuration (committed to git, points to production Heroku server)
- **`.env.local`** - Local overrides (not committed to git)

To use a local development server, create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# .env.local
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

Available environment variables:

| Variable                | Description                     | Default                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `VITE_SERVER_URL`       | Phalanx game server URL         | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth Client ID for auth | (none - auth disabled)  |

### Authentication Setup

To enable Google Sign-In authentication:

1. **Create a Google OAuth Client ID**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Set Application type to "Web application"
   - Add Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
     - Your production domain
   - Add Authorized redirect URIs (same as origins):
     - `http://localhost:5173`
     - Your production domain
   - Copy both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

2. **Configure the client** (babylon-ecs):
   - Create `.env.local` with:
     ```bash
     VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
     VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

3. **Configure the server** (game-test-server):
   - Create `.env` with:
     ```bash
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     ```
   - The client ID must match between client and server
   - The client secret is kept secure on the server (never exposed to browser)

**How it works:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" → redirected to Google OAuth
2. After sign-in, Google redirects back with an authorization code
3. Client sends code to server's `/auth/token` endpoint
4. Server exchanges code for tokens using `client_secret` (secure!)
5. Client receives ID token and uses it for game authentication

When authentication is enabled:
- Users see "Sign in with Google" button in the lobby
- After signing in, "Find Game" button appears
- JWT tokens are sent to the server with WebSocket connections

### Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

This compiles TypeScript and builds optimized assets into the `dist/` folder.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Controls

| Action              | Input                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Select Unit         | Left-click on unit         |
| Move Selected Units | Right-click on ground      |
| Deselect            | Left-click on empty ground |

## Tech Stack

## Architecture

This project follows an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture pattern:

- **Entities** are containers that hold components (Unit, Tower)
- **Components** are pure data containers (HealthComponent, AttackComponent)
- **Systems** contain logic and operate on entities with specific components

For detailed architecture documentation and development guidelines, see [DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).
