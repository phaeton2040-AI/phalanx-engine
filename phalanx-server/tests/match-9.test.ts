 * LOCKSTEP-3: Server Broadcasts Tick Commands on Timer

 * Tests for tick-driven command broadcasting:
 * - Server advances ticks based on tick rate
 * - Commands are broadcast on each tick
 * - Server does NOT wait for players to submit
 * - Commands are sorted by playerId for deterministic order
 * - Empty command batches are valid
